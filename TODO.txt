Known issues:

Need to flexibly define the netCDF file variables according to the type of file encountered:
	- workhorse data, straight from the instrument
	- workhorse data, exported as pd0 from Velocity
	- sentinel V data exported as pd0 from Velocity (e.g. with 5th beam)
	
Need to Compute depths of cells and add depth as an ordinate variables

Would like to restructure as a module that can be loaded instead of one long script full of defs, was having trouble doing this and using Spyder at the same time - unresolved spyder path issues.
