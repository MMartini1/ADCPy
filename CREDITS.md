Where did all this come from?  I did not write it all myself...

pd0.py, adcpwaves.py were inspiration and learning for me, written by
Gregory P Dusek <gdusek@email.unc.edu> - original prototype
Sara M Haines <sara_haines@unc.edu> - project management
Chris Calloway <cbc@unc.edu> (cbcunc) - testing, release management
Harvey E Seim <hseim@email.unc.edu> - chief science officer
