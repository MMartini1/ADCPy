Where did all this come from?  I did not conceive it all myself... inspiration came from:

rotation techniques from TRDI and https://github.com/lkilcher/dolfyn
(though I still need to learn how to use einsum correctly)

pd0.py, adcpwaves.py were inspiration and learning for me, written by
Gregory P Dusek <gdusek@email.unc.edu> - original prototype
Sara M Haines <sara_haines@unc.edu> - project management
Chris Calloway <cbc@unc.edu> (cbcunc) - testing, release management
Harvey E Seim <hseim@email.unc.edu> - chief science officer
And the original so far is still here:  http://trac.nccoos.org/dataproc

And for holding my hand while trying to unlearn lots of past programming thinking in order to learn python:
Tarandeep Kalra, Dan Nowacki, Rich Signell
